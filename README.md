# C2C12 2021 Figure Repo

This repository contains the code to generate each of the figures from our 2021 manuscript on LR-Split-seq.

<!-- which can be found [here](). -->

Each figure is in its own directory with an explanation of the preprocessing steps that were performed to generate the data used to make the plots. 

If you're interested in running any of the code, please run [this bash script](https://github.com/fairliereese/2021_c2c12/tree/master/scripts/download_data.sh) first, which will download all of the necessary files. Warning! This is a LOT of data! (~18 GB)
